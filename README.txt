# USO Generator

This repository conntains code for generating "Unidentified Sound Objects" (USOs) by combining anechoic recordings from a data base of different real world sounds randomly. 

The code was created by converting the original matlab scripts into one python script, with some suitable adjustments implemented. 

It also contains other python scripts, that can be used to alter the generated sounds. For detailed explanation see the according scripts.
