# USO Generator

## In this repository I work in code that will be able to generate "USO" sounds based on the Mitsubishi .wav files

## It should be able to:

### read sound files in and play them back (still to be done)
### combine them in different ways (still to be done)
### analyze them for their frequency spectrum and, depending on that, categorize them (still to be done)
### combine them depending on their frequency spectrum (still to be done)
